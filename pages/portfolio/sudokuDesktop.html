                This application is both a Sudoku game and a Sudoku puzzle solver.
                Users can generate Sudoku puzzles on their devices and play them.
                The game offers three levels of difficulty from which users can choose.
                Additionally, there is a toolbar that users can access for hints on specific puzzle cells.
                <br> User input can be accomplished through physical devices or a virtual interface designed within the game.

            <p>
                How did I end up creating this application? In short, it's quite a journey. I applied for an internship
                 during my apprenticeship at a relatively large company. 
                As part of the application process, they asked me to develop an application with 
                a graphical user interface (GUI) that allowed users 
                to input an incomplete Sudoku puzzle, and then my algorithm should solve it.
                This was the test assignment to secure the internship, which I completed. What's more, 
                I also developed an algorithm to generate these Sudoku puzzles  
                This project marked my first experience with OOP, and I was
                 determined to acquire more knowledge through hands-on experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I wasn't accepted for the internship. Despite the setback, I enjoyed the challenge, 
                even though I wasn't adequately prepared at the time to write clean code and adhere 
                to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                P.S. <br> I took pride in my fully functioning application, particularly because I grew up in a 
                time when PCs weren't popular, and smartphones didn't exist yet. As a result, one of my 'ingenious' 
                ways to pass the time was solving Sudoku puzzles in newspapers. 
                This childhood pastime unexpectedly became a valuable skill for this challenge.
