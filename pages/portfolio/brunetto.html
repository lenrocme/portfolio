                The Brunetto Application is a minimalist calculator designed for one primary 
                purpose: <br> calculating net salaries from gross incomes and also offer detailed report.     
                <br> <br>
                The app also offers the option to share the calculated net salary and the 
                comprehensive tax calculation report with the user. This feature can be 
                helpful if the user wishes to share results with others or save them for 
                future reference.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The net salary is calculated based on the following user inputs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly/annual gross salary input</li>
                <li>Tax class selection</li>
                <li>Federal state</li>
                <li>Church tax</li>
                <li>Child allowances</li>
                <li>Private/statutory health insurance</li>
                <li>One-time payments, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This app is exclusively tailored to German salaries and tax 
                systems. All calculations are provided without a guarantee.

            <h2>Story:</h2>
            <p>
                In order to make this application work, I used the following 
                <a href="https://www.bmf-steuerrechner.de/interface/programmablauf.xhtml">website</a>. 
                It contains a PAP diagram and two tables data (results) that I utilized to 
                test the application's functionality. These tables, with their 
                data, were invaluable for writing tests, and having more data from 
                various cases for testing would be even more beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
                I initially undertook the development of this application with the 
                assumption that it would only take one to two weeks. I couldn't 
                have been more wrong. The actual time spent on the project turned 
                out to be around several months. There were a couple of reasons for 
                this prolonged timeline. First, I didn't employ testing from the very 
                beginning, and secondly, the updates from 2022 to 2023 on how the 
                calculations should be done added complexity. In the end, I ended up 
                handling multiple scenarios, including the changes that occurred 
                in July 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the challenges and extended timeline, I found this experience 
                to be quite rewarding. I'm considering the possibility of keeping the 
                application updated with each year's changes in how the net salary 
                is calculated.
