            <h2>Story:</h2>
            <p>
                This application is a personal project that I developed during my 'Ausbildung' (apprenticeship). It is also my very first application with a graphical user interface (GUI). 
            </p>

            <p>
                While learning at 'Ausbildung' about subnetting, I decided to put my knowledge to the test, which I had acquired earlier from a 'Sololearn' Python course. Even though subnetting was more relevant to the System Integrator group, I decided to take a shot at it. I wrote numerous scripts that initially operated only in console mode, yielding specific components for subnetting. Later, I integrated these components into this application, complete with a GUI.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose KivyMD for the GUI, thinking it could be useful for mobile development in the future, but as it turns out, that wasn't quite the case.
