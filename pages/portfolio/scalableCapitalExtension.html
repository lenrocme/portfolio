                This is a browser extension designed specifically for the Scalable Capital website 
                <a href="https://de.scalable.capital/">link</a>. It inserts a chart into the website's Portfolio page, 
                allowing users to visualize the state of their portfolio not just in terms of the 
                amount of money but also in percentage terms. Users can choose between two tabs: 
                one displays only stocks, and the other includes both stocks and groups in the diagram. 
                Additionally, users have the option to include the percentage of cash relative 
                to other stocks in the diagram.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Data is collected from the client side only to generate the diagram, 
                there are no any endpoints used to collect and get any data from the user.

            <p>
                I conducted an experiment with one of my good friends (Hello, Christian), who works as 
                a software developer. After creating this extension and ensuring that it worked correctly, 
                I called him and shared my screen, displaying the website where the content of 
                this extension had already been inserted. Without revealing which part of the website 
                was original and which was my content, 
                I asked him, 'Can you please tell me which part of the website is the content inserted by my extension?'
                What happened next was quite amusing. He responded, saying, 'The chart is definitely not 
                yours because it's a must-have for investment-related websites where users need to 
                visualize their portfolio's status graphically'. Well, he definitely has a valid point, 
                and his perspective is sound. However, as you already know, the Pie Chart was created by my extension. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why did I decide to write about this experiment here? Well, when I initially 
                started creating this application, I questioned whether there was a purpose for this extension. 
                This experiment serves as a compelling answer to my own question.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the realm of 'neo-brokers,' a graphical view is not just a want but a necessity. 
                It's essential not only for clients but also for video bloggers. Many advertisements 
                are now integrated into videos by YouTubers. As someone deeply interested in investments 
                and actively learning about it for a year, I've watched countless YouTubers showcasing 
                their portfolios, and almost every one of them uses graphical charts to display their 
                portfolio's status. I can't recall a single one who didn't employ a graphical chart.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion YouTubers and other bloggers are among the most significant avenues 
                for advertising investment through neo-brokers, as opposed to traditional methods. 
                So, the moral of the story is that a graphical view of a portfolio's status is an 
                absolute must-have.
            </p>
            <p>
                P.S. <br>
                After I invested all my savings namely 345,98 â‚¬, with the assistance of my extension, 
                I gained a better graphical perspective on the state of my portfolio.
